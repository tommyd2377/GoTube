GoTube is a video sharing app built with React and Ruby on Rails. It fetches YouTube video metadata from the YouTube API. Users can search YouTube from a search input field on the frontend. The user-user relationship is based on the following model, users can follow other users to get video recomendations based on the videos that their followees like. Users can watch YouTube videos from within the app. I will be using an authentication system on the backend.
